# COVID19-Predictive-Modeling
COVID-19 Predictive Modelling Capstone Project

Overview

This project aims to analyze and model the spread of COVID-19 using historical data. The goal is to provide actionable insights for public health organizations to anticipate future outbreaks, allocate resources, and inform policy decisions.

The deliverables include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling (time-series and classification), visualizations, and actionable recommendations for public health responses.



Project Objectives

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, correlations, and outliers.

3. Predictive Modelling:

• Time-Series Forecasting to predict future cases.

• Classification Models to predict outcomes based on features.

4. Data Visualization: Generate informative plots for trends and model predictions.

5. Recommendations: Provide actionable insights for stakeholders.


Technologies Used

• Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.

• Tools: Google Colab, GitHub, Google Slides.


Folder Structure

• Code: Contains the .ipynb file used for modeling and visualization.

• Presentation: A slide deck summarizing the project’s findings and insights.

• Report: Detailed technical report covering the methodology, results, and recommendations.


Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository using:

git clone <repository-link>  


2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab.

3. Install necessary libraries if required:

pip install -r requirements.txt  


4. Execute cells sequentially in the notebook.



Deliverables

1. Code Repository: This GitHub repository with all the project’s code.



Key Findings and Insights

• Time-Series Forecasting showed an upward trend in certain regions, indicating a need for proactive health resource allocation.

• Classification models achieved high recall, ensuring accurate prediction of critical outcomes.

• Demographic factors such as age and population density significantly influence COVID-19 transmission.
